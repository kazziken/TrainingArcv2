Given the roots of two binary tree root and subRoot, return true if there is
a subtree of root with the same structure and node values of subRoot and false

A subtree of binary tree 'tree' is a tree that consists of a node in tree and
all of these node's descendants. The tree could also be considered a subtree of itself
